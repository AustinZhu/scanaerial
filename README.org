* scanaerial
 - Scan for areas of similar colour on aerial pictures like OCR for text.
 - recognition works well with lakes it will not produce good results with
   wood in near future.
   
* Features/Changelog
** 1.0.2
 - added tag source:zoomlevel. You see sometimes very different details
   in different zoomlevels.

** 1.0.1
 - inner and outer Multipolygon work

** 1.0.0
 - TMS Zoomlevel of JOSM is used for the downloaded WMS Tiles
 - scanaerial works with Ext_tools Plugin 

* Requirements
 - JOSM
 - Python. You can run library_check.py to find out if a library is missing
 - Ext_tools plug-in for JOSM. 
   {TZoom} is part of Ext_tools since Ext_tools 25274 
 - Of course you need the scanaerial files too.
   You will find the latest releases on
   [[https://github.com/jonasstein/scanaerial/archives/master]]
   Copy them to JOSM/plugins/scanaerial for example.

* Setup
 - unzip the contents of the downloaded archive to the JOSM plugin directory 
   Linux users put it to: ~/.josm/plugins/ext_tools/scanaerial
 - start JOSM, press F12 and go to Ext_tools configuration
 - use this cmdline:/home/<username>/.josm/plugins/ext_tools/scanaerial/scanaerial.py {lat} {lon} {TZoom}
   It will create a new menu item in JOSM. (NB: Syntax may change soon)
   Due to a bug in Ext_tools you can not write "~" instead of "home"
 - For best result you may finetune the values in scanaerial.cfg

 | key                     | function                                                |
 |-------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------|
 | fixedzoomlevel          | use this zoomlevel, if Ext_tools did not tell via TZoom |
 | wmsname                 | name of the WMS Source (only for the tag string)        |
 | wms_server_url          | you may choose your favourite WMS server                |
 | projection              | projection that is used on the WMS server               |
 | tile_sizex,-y           | leave it to 256 unless you know what you do             |
 | douglas_peucker_epsilon | maximum roughness for smoothening the line              |
 | colour_str              | colour sensitivity                                      |
 | maxfilter_setting       | how many times should we apply the smoothening?         |

* Roadmap
 - collect recipies for better algorithms
 - try to exclude douglas-peucker from scanaerial. josm can do that.
 - try different algorithms in forks and compare them. 
 - try to access cached wms tiles from josm
 - rewrite in c(++) and/or java
* Troubleshooting
 - if anything fails have a look on the error console. 
   Scanaerial is very verbous.

* scanaerial

   wood in near future.
   
* Features/Changelog
  
** 1.0.0
 - TMS Zoomlevel of JOSM is used for the downloaded WMS Tiles
 - scanaerial works with Ext_tools Plugin 

* Requirements
 - JOSM
 - Python. You can run libary_check.py to find out if a library is missing
 - Ext_tools plug-in for JOSM. 
   {TZoom} is part of Ext_tools since Ext_tools 25274
   Today (<2011-02-14 Mon>) this is not yet released. 
   You can find it here: 
   [[http://svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/editors/josm/dist/ext_tools.jar]]
   If you use a older release substitude {TZoom} by the Zoomlevel 
   you want: 13 for example.
 - Of course you need the scanaerial files too.
   You will find the latest releases on
   [[https://github.com/jonasstein/scanaerial/archives/master]]
   Copy them to JOSM/plugins/scanaerial for example.

* Setup
 - In JOSM press F12 and go to Ext_tools configuration
 - use this cmdline:/home/<username>/.josm/plugins/ext_tools/scanaerial/scanaerial.py {lat} {lon} {TZoom}
   It will create a new menu item in JOSM. (NB: Syntax may change soon)
 - For best result you may finetune the values in scanaerial.cfg

   Scanaerial is very verbous.
